# SOC Home Lab – Splunk SIEM

## Objective

The SOC Detection Lab project establishes a controlled, enterprise-style environment to **simulate cyber attacks, generate telemetry, and detect malicious activity using Splunk SIEM**. The lab ingests logs from Windows and Linux endpoints, correlates events generated by adversary emulation (Kali Linux) and Atomic Red Team, and produces detections aligned to **MITRE ATT&CK**. The goal is to demonstrate practical SOC, blue team, and detection engineering skills through hands-on implementation and clear documentation.

---

### Skills Learned

* Practical SIEM deployment and administration (Splunk Enterprise)
* Log ingestion, normalization, and correlation across multiple data sources
* Windows telemetry analysis using Sysmon and Event Logs
* Linux authentication and audit log analysis
* Adversary emulation and attack simulation (Kali Linux, Atomic Red Team)
* Detection engineering mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
* Incident triage, investigation, and reporting
* Security documentation and GitHub project presentation

---

### Tools Used

* **Splunk Enterprise** – SIEM for log ingestion, search, and detection
* **Splunk Universal Forwarder** – Endpoint log forwarding
* **Windows 10/11** – Endpoint telemetry generation
* **Sysmon** – Enhanced Windows event logging
* **Atomic Red Team** – MITRE ATT&CK-based attack simulation
* **Ubuntu Linux** – Linux endpoint logging (auth.log, auditd)
* **Kali Linux** – Adversary emulation and attack execution
* **Virtualization Platform** (VMware / VirtualBox)

## Steps & Implementation

### 1. Network Configuration

All virtual machines are connected to a NAT-Network "Home-Lab-Network".

Lab Addressing:
- Splunk SIEM: 192.168.10.15
- Windows 10 Endpoint: 192.168.10.4
- Ubuntu Endpoint: 192.168.10.5
- Kali Attacker: 192.168.10.7

## Lab Evolution & Roadmap

This project is designed as a **living SOC environment** that evolves over time. Instead of creating separate labs, new security controls and capabilities are incrementally integrated into the same architecture to reflect how real enterprise SOCs mature.

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to **design, operate, and continuously enhance a SOC detection environment**. By incrementally integrating new security technologies into a single evolving lab, the project mirrors real-world SOC growth and showcases long-term commitment to defensive security learning.

## Disclaimer

All attack activity is conducted in a **controlled and isolated lab environment** for defensive and educational purposes only.
